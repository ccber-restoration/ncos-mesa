# Overview

This repository was originally created for working with data on the soil characteristics of the "Mesa Slope" in North Campus Open Space (specifically volumetric water content collected in the first half of 2025), to explore how they may be influencing the plant community. The scope has since been expanded to broadly encompass soil and plant research taking place on the the Mesa area. This could include research related to soil amendments, vegetation in burn plots, among other foci.

# Data

-  Gravimetric soil data was collected by Jacob Pike, Kellen Pierce, Zephyr Moss, and Sydney Beckett. They used a shared Google Drive folder: "CCBER Soils Team Data". https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1KuaGsWqHGZcds0SsivSqpVOM9jRhxu1n
    -  Soil samples were collected on 2025-02-25, 2025-04-07, 2025-04-23,
2025-05-07, 2025-06-01, and...

-  Volumetric water content is continuously collected by a sensor array starting 2025-01-29.

-  Lara Roelofs continued work on soil salinity and moisture during summer 2025: Grassland_salinity_2025 (1).xlsx
-  Emilee Doering continued work on soil salinity, moisture, texture and veg cover in fall 2025: NCOS Mesa Soil Data 10_20_2025.xlsx

# Code

-  00_setup.R does some set up for plotting volumetric water content data (Jan-July 2025)
-  mesa_soils.R plots volumetric water content data and gravimetric water content together (Jan-July 2025)
-  sep2025_salinity_moisture_texture_cover.R was written by Lara Roelofs for working with salinity, moisture, soil texture, and veg cover (summer 2025). Produces the following figures:
    -    soil texture.png
    -    Veg cover.png
    -    Soil moisture.png
    -    Salinity µm.png
    -    Salinity dS.png
