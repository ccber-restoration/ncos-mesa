# Overview

This repository is for working with data on the soil characteristics of the "Mesa Slope" in North Campus Open Space, to explore how they may be influencing the plant community.

# Data

-  Gravimetric soil data was collected by Jacob Pike, Kellen Pierce, Zephyr Moss, and Sydney Beckett. They used a shared Google Drive folder: "CCBER Soils Team Data". https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1KuaGsWqHGZcds0SsivSqpVOM9jRhxu1n
    -  Soil samples were collected on 2025-02-25, 2025-04-07, 2025-04-23,
2025-05-07, 2025-06-01, and...

-  Volumetric water content is continuously collected by a sensor array starting 2025-01-29.

-  Lara Roelofs continued work on soil salinity and moisture during summer 2025.

# Code

-  00_setup.R does some set up for plotting volumetric water content data (Jan-July 2025)
-  mesa_soils.R plots volumetric water content data and gravimetric water content together (Jan-July 2025)
-  sep2025_salinity_moisture_texture_cover.R was written by Lara Roelofs for working with salinity, moisture, soil texture, and veg cover (summer 2025)
